• Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
• A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
• manipulate collections of data in a declarative way (you express a query rather than code an ad hoc implementation for it).
• Streams can be processed in parallel transparently, without you having to write any multithreaded code
	
The features of Java stream are –

• A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
• Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
• the Streams API in Java 8 lets you write code that’s
	○  Declarative— More concise and readable
	○  Composable— Greater flexibility
	○  Parallelizable— Better performance
